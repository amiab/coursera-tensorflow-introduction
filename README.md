### Coursera Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning by deeplearning.ai taught by Laurence Moroney

Getting started with with Convolutional Neural Networks using Tensorflow.Keras for building Image Classifiers.

Exercises were completed and submitted in Jupyter notebooks. I trained and tested the models in Google Colab and also implemented them on my local environment using PyCharm IDE to understand what the code is doing.

I installed Tensorflow 2.2.0 and Pillow 7.1.2. List of packages can be found in the requirements.txt

## Exercises

* Exercise_1: Predict house prices (TBA) 
* Exercise_2: Implement MNIST classifier to recognise handwriting
* Exercise_3: Improve MNIST clssifier with Convolutions
* Exercise_4: Create a CNN that trains on images
